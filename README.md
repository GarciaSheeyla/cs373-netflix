cs373-netflix
=============

Requirements

   1) Estimate time to completion.
   2) Create a private Git repository at GitHub, named cs373-netflix.
   3) Add these requirements to the issue tracker at GitHub, at least 10 issues. Add at least 10 more issues, one for each bug or  feature, both open and closed with a good description and a label.
   4) Invite the grader to your private code repo.
   5) Clone your private code repo onto your local directory.
   6) Make at least 5 commits, one for each bug or feature.
      If you cannot describe your changes in a sentence, you are not committing often enough.
      Make meaningful commit messages identifying the corresponding issue in the issue tracker (see here).
   7) Clone the public class repo onto your local directory.
      It is critical that you clone the public class repo into a different directory than the one you're using for your private code repo.
   8) Copy the code files from the clone of the public class repo to the clone of the private code repo.
   9) Write unit tests in TestNetflix.py that test corner cases and failure cases until you have an average of 3 tests for each function, confirm the expected failures, and add, commit, and push to the private code repo.
  10) Implement and debug the simplest possible solution in Netflix.py with assertions that check pre-conditions, post-conditions, argument validity, and return-value validity, until all tests pass, and add, commit, and push to the private code repo.
  11) Create 1000 lines of acceptance tests in RunNetflix.in and RunNetflix.out that test corner cases and failure cases, and add, commit, and push to the private code repo.
  12) Clone the public test repo onto your local directory.
      It is critical that you clone the public test repo into a different directory than the one you're using for your private code repo.
  13) Copy your unit tests and your acceptance tests to your clone of the public test repo, rename the files, do a git pull to synchronize your clone, and then add, commit and push to the public test repo.
      The files MUST be named <cs-username>-RunNetflix.in, <cs-username>-RunNetflix.out, <cs-username>-TestNetflix.py, and <cs-username>-TestNetflix.out in the public test repo.
  14) Implement (or reuse) and debug the simplest possible set of caches until all tests pass, and add, commit, and push to the private code repo.
  15) Run pydoc on Netflix.py, which will create Netflix.html, that then documents the interfaces to your functions.
      Create inline comments if you need to explain the why of a particular implementation.
      Use a consistent coding convention with good variable names, good indentation, blank lines, and blank spaces.
  16) Create a log of your commits in Netflix.log.
  17) Obtain the git SHA with % git rev-parse HEAD
  18) Fill in the Google Form.
  19) It is your responsibility to protect your code from the rest of the students in the class. If your code gets out, you are as guilty as the recipient of academic dishonesty.
